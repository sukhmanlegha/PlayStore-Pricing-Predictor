# PlayStore-Pricing-Predictor
This project involves the prediction of app pricing on the Google Play Store through the utilization of Support Vector Machines (SVM). Leveraging a dataset derived from Kaggle, which encapsulates details on around four thousand apps, the model is trained to classify apps as either free or paid based on features like average user ratings, reviews, installs, app size, last update date, minimum Android version, current version, and pricing information. The SVM's performance is assessed by splitting the data into training and testing sets, and an evaluation is conducted with varying parameter values such as C and gamma. The presented code encompasses data preprocessing, model training, and parameter tuning, offering a comprehensive approach to predicting app pricing with a focus on achieving optimal classification accuracy.

In a separate task, the project undertakes the task of determining an optimal clustering parameter (k) for a dataset containing 500 data points and 30 features from data1.csv. Employing the KMeans clustering algorithm with varying values of k (ranging from 1 to 10), the code calculates the cost of each clustering and generates an elbow plot. This visualization aids in identifying the elbow point, signifying the optimal value for k in the context of clustering the given dataset. The analysis provides valuable insights into the structure of the data and aids in making informed decisions regarding the appropriate number of clusters for downstream applications.
